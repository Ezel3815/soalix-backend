# Sync the database to prisma/schema.prisma, then start the app.
# Earlier deploys never ran migrations, so the DB may have no migration
# history and `migrate deploy` could block every deploy. `db push` adds what
# is missing (xp column, UserAchievement, ActivityEvent) and refuses
# destructive changes; if it can't run, the server still starts and the
# reason is in the logs.
# The compiled entry is dist/src/main.js (prisma/ is compiled too); fall back
# to dist/main.js if the layout ever changes.
